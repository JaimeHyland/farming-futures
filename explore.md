# Explore this short selection of resources on the future of farming

## Introductory reading material
Reading University provides an excellent article discussing the possible positive and negative effects of the fourth agricultural revolution that now happening all over the world due to new technology in data science, artificial intelligence and robotics.

Check out this interesting [article](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/AI-examples-that-can-be-used-effectively-in-agriculture) by [Lisa Morgan](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Lisa-Morgan) of Techttarget.com, in which she lists some real-world applications of AI and machine learning in agriculture.

[This fascinating video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0PCSH2n8YU) from AHDB Horticulture opens with a fascinating machine in use in the Netherlands that combines visual machine learning with highly advanced manipulation robotics to select cuttings and place them correctly in their rooting medium. What follows is a demo of more traditional robotics extremely widely used in the most modern horticultural industry in the world.

This podcast is interesting.

## Enterprises working in the sector

[agritecture.com](https://www.agritecture.com/) is a mid-sized actor in the promotion of and in education on 'climate-smart agriculture' specialising in urban and controlled environment food production. Their [blog feed](https://www.agritecture.com/blog-feed) is full of interesting insights into the fast-developing sector.
