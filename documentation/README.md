First code institute portfolio project demonstrating html and css competence. A static site.

## Introduction
This website was prepared for presentation as a first portfolio project for my online course in Full-Stack programming with the Code Institute, based in Blackrock, Co. Dublin. I have interpreted the as being to exhibit my ability to produce a simple website
using effectively only html and css technologies. This includes a requirement to make at least basic adjustments so that the website looks professional and complete, but as my course is not in creative web design, I have not spent much time nor made much effort on finer
aesthetic questions. The site should be judged according to the criteria set out under the headings set out below:

##Accessibility

I have given all images used (other than merely decorative background images) a sr-readable alt text. Throughout the website, font colours appear on sufficiently contrasting backgrounds, with the addition where necessary of semi-opaque background colours over
background images.

##Acknowledgement of others' work and inspiration and help from others.

All the code is my own, though much of it follows closely the code created by Jo Heyndels for the 'Love Running' walkthrough project. Many thanks are due to Jo for her lovely static website and her clear instructions and high-quality learning material. 
I have of course researched widely to find out how to implement features not included in Jo's website, including many visits to the following sites. With the exception of the favicon I created, none of the images used on this project were original to me.
I have provided acknowlegements for each of the images individually below.

I have made use of a lot of publicly available information on the internet, including the following sites:
w3schools.com
stackoverflow.com
freecodecamp.com
...

##Development and implementation environment, and iterative deployment
All the code created during this project was written using gitpod.io, with version control using git, and deployed using github on a daily basis.

##Design methodology version control philosophy
The code was written on a section-by-section according to "mobile-first" principle, only building screen-query-based responsiveness into the product once the broad lines of the app were built and tested on the Galaxy-S8 emulator provided by Google. If I were to do the
job again, I might well change my approach. I provide more details in the "Lessons learnt" section below.
I committed new changes relatively often, and tried to keep a certain thematic logic to the changes included in each commit, but I did make some minor changes "on the fly" as I encountered them, sometimes not mentioning them at all in commit comments. I have tried to
make sure such undocumented changes and bug fixes were limited to minor tweaks. I made pretty intensive use of the "git diff HEAD" command to make sure of this.
 
##Testing, validation and troubleshooting
The main browser against which my code was tested in an iterative process (running a smoke test before every commit at the very least) was the latest version of Google Chrome (using the development toolkit provided by Google). Near the end of the development process, 
I used my own Samsung Galaxy A7 (running on the latest version of Chrome), my ipod (running on the latest version of Safari), and my laptop, using the latest versions of Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. Owing to lack of time, I was unable to do any testing on any 
legacy versions of these or on any other browsers or machines.
